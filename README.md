# dot-files
It's a pain setting everything up each time, so this seemed like a good idea.

Initially it's designed to work on Ubuntu and other Linux Vms.  I might try setting up other things in the future.

## Install Script
This script assumes that you're starting in a fresh Ubuntu 15 box.

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/njhazelh/dot-files/master/install.sh -O -)"
```

## Components
1. Installs
  - zsh
  - oh my zsh
  - vim
2. Configures
  - vim
  - zsh
  - ssh keys

This is a work in progress,
