It's a pain setting everything up each time, so this seemed like a good idea.

Initially it's designed to work on Ubuntu and other Linux Vms.  I might try setting up other things in the future.

## Components
1. Installs
  - zsh
  - oh my zsh
  - vim
2. Configures
  - vim
  - zsh
  - ssh keys

This is a work in progress,
